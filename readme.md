## Problem 2.5: Stack 'em Up[^1]
### Problem description
This program determines the order of a deck of cards after several "shuffles". Each shuffle rearanges the deck of cards into a predetermined order. Initially the deck of cards is arranged alphabetically by suit then by value. The suits are as follows: 

1. Two
2. Three
3. Four
4. five
5. Six
6. Seven
7. Eight
8. Nine
9. Ten
10. Jack
11. Queen
12. King
13. Ace

The input consists of a line denoting the number of test cases to run, followed by a blank line. Then repeats: 
A line containing the number of shuffles (n <= 100);
'n' lines denoting the arrangements of cards after the shuffle;
several lines indicating the shuffle to perform on the deck of cards.
A blank line if computing the next test case, or EOF if at the end of the final test case
